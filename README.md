# Daily Planner App

Streamline your day with our user-friendly calendar. Easily add, manage, and track your daily events. Stay organized effortlessly.

- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
